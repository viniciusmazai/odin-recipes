    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This technique for making corn ribs will make you <em>forget everything</em> you know about eating corn on the cobâ€”and will, without a doubt, become your favorite way of making corn.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Spice Mix:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Corn Ribs:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears fresh corn, shucked</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together salt, chili powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, trim off both ends of each ear of corn to expose the cob.<br>
            Stand cob on end, and carefully cut corn in half down the exact center of the cob, rocking the knife while applying downward pressure from the top.<br>
            Stand each cob half on end, and cut into quarters using the same method. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil over corn; sprinkle on about 2/3 of spice mixture.<br>
            Toss well, being sure to smear spices and oil evenly over each rib.</li>
        <li>Ribs can now be finished on a charcoal grill, until hot and well browned.</li>
        <li>To finish indoors, preheat the oven's broiler and set a rack 7 to 8 inches from the heating element.<br>
            Line a baking pan with foil.</li> 
        <li>Arrange corn ribs on the prepared pan with the maximum number of kernels facing up, toward the heat.<br>
            Extra foil can be placed on the pan to prop up ribs into the right position.<br>
            Once arranged, sprinkle with more spice mixture if so desired.</li>
        <li>Broil on High until corn starts to brown in spots, about 7 minutes.<br>
            Remove and rearrange ribs as needed, so that areas of kernels that are not yet browned are facing up toward the heat, and continue to broil until corn is golden-brown with some charred spots, 7 to 8 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove and brush with melted butter; season to taste with remaining spice mixture.</li> 
    </ol>
